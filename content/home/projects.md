**Modeling RNA G-quadruplexes**

G-quadruplex (G4) formations are secondary structures in DNA or RNA sequences that have been known to play an important role in cells and affect gene regulation. G4 formations, if unstable, have been found to be linked to genetic diseases. Currently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network has proven to perform well on G4 detection. Here, we explore other deep learning methods that are able to improve upon the current state-of-the-art models.

**APAeval**

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an RNA-processing mechanism that generates distinct 3â€™ termini on transcripts, allowing a single gene to encode multiple variants.Studies have reported a critical role for APA-mediated gene regulation during development or disease. Given the importance of APA, identifying and quantifying usage of identified polyadenylation sites (PAS) on a global scale is critical for understanding the underlying mechanisms of APA-mediated gene regulation. Here, we evaluate computational methods for the detection and quantification of poly(A) sites and estimating their differential usage across RNA-seq samples

**Modeling Transcription Factor Binding**

Cooperative DNA-binding by transcription factor (TF) proteins is critical for gene expression regulation in eukaryotes. Currently, the rules that drive cooperative versus independent binding of TFs to  neighboring sites are not well understood. Here, we developed models of cooperative DNA-binding for TF proteins, using human factors ETS1 and RUNX1 as our case study, based on a high-throughput assay designed specifically to detect cooperativity.

**GENESIS: Gene-specific machine learning models for variants of uncertain significance**

Genetic mutations found in the heart have been linked to arrhythmic heart disease. Here, we developed gene-specific machine learning models for variants of uncertain significance found in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome-associated genes. Results from the models were used to help determine the suitable treatments of patients suffering from hereditary irregular heartbeat but had unclear genetic testing results.

**Predict mortality and allocate palliatve care for older patients with hip fracture**

Each year 300,000+ older adults are treated for hip fracture in the United States.1 For the majority who suffer a fractured hip, the likelihood of full functional recovery remains low, and other related poor health outcomes include permanent nursing home placement and excess mortality. Here investigate the use machine learning models for mortality prediction in older adult hip fracture patients using Medicare assessment and administrative claims data with the overall goal of allocating palliative care resources more effectively.
