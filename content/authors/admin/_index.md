I am a computer science PhD student at University of Pennsylvania advised by {{< staticref "https://www.biociphers.org/yosephb" "newtab" >}}Dr. Yoseph Barash{{< /staticref >}}. My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and biology. Part of my work right now is on using deep learning methods to detect important RNA secondary structures like G-quadruplexes that have been shown to have significant regulatory roles and are associated with cancers. 

Before coming to Penn, I received a B.S in applied mathematics from UCSD and an M.S in computer science from Duke, where I was advised by {{< staticref "https://gordanlab.cs.duke.edu/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Raluca Gordan{{< /staticref >}} working on transcription factor binding model.
